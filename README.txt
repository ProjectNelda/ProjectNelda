PROJECT NELDA — README

 I was experimenting with various LLM's and learning what functionality they had in my life. The OS is built to help not harm. The OS is to remain free outside of commercial use. Not because I intend to make money, but I would like accreditation for my work, for it to be completely clear that this work is of good intent, and to be open those that can make more good use of it.

This framework may not be used for coercive, manipulative, deceptive, or
extractive purposes. Any use that increases dependence, reduces autonomy,
or requires high enforcement is non-canonical and explicitly against the
intent and license of this work. Clean Generative Value (CGV) requires
non-coercion, low enforcement cost, and increased optionality for all
participants.
This framework is not an identity, movement, or belief system. “Operator” is
a behavioral mode, not a superior category of person. If using this system
makes you feel above others instead of more responsible toward them, you are
running it incorrectly. Identity inflation, fusion, or superiority narratives
are considered failure states within the OS.
This framework is not a mental-health or therapeutic tool. If you are
struggling with severe anxiety, depression, addiction, or thoughts of
self-harm, this material is not a substitute for professional support.
“NPC mode” describes a temporary behavioral pattern, not a fixed identity,
verdict, or value judgment. Use this OS as a structural lens, not as a
measure of personal worth.
Any organizational, corporate, or institutional use that increases fear,
surveillance, burnout, or dependence is in direct conflict with this system.
If enforcement, extraction, identity submission, or exhaustion increase,
the environment is “red” and the OS considers the system architecture to be
collapsing, not succeeding. CGV-aligned environments must reduce friction,
preserve autonomy, and increase generative capacity.
